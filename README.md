# IPL-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
A data analysis project on Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project involves exploring the dataset, uncovering patterns, and visualizing key statistics like top teams, most wins, toss decisions, venue trends, and player performance using bar plots, count plots.
This project presents an in-depth analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League) match data using powerful Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset contains detailed match information such as teams, venues, winners, toss outcomes, and more.

Using data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques, we uncover hidden trends and answer questions like:

Which team has the most wins?

How does toss decision affect match outcome?

Who are the top-performing players?

Which venues favor which teams?

How has team performance changed over the seasons?


ðŸ“Š Visualizations include:

Bar plots

Count plots

Pie charts

Line plots

Heatmaps


This project demonstrates how to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and visualize insights to understand the dynamics of the IPL.
